% This will help you in writing your homebook
% Remember that the character % is a comment in latex

% Divide the work you have done in each of the chapters used 
% during the lab lessons in a new chapter, as in the example below, 
% using a coherent title 


% For each chapter you can include :

%-----------------------------
% VHDL file, using the sintax:


	%\begin{listato}
	%\lstinputlisting{./exeMPLE/listato1.vhd}
	%\end{listato}

% the path to the file must be correct, obviously
% Should you have listings written in other languages the method is the 
% same, but the language set up must be changed using a different 
% setting for the command \lstset{language=VHDL} in file homebook.tex 


%-----------------------------
% figures in postcript (ps) or encapsulated postcript (eps)
% format, using the syntax:

%	\begin{figure}[h]
%	\centering
%	\includegraphics[width=9cm]{./cap1/figure1.eps}
%	\caption{Put a caption if you want (didascalia...:)))}
%	\label{put-a-label-for-referring-to-this-picture}	
%	\end{figure}

% the path to the file must be correct, obviously
% you can refer to this picture in any point of your document
% by typing the instruction:

% 	\ref{put-a-label-for-referring-to-this-picture}

% that is using the same label you put in the fiure label
% when you will run the "latex command" an automatic reference to
% this figure with the correct enumeration will be inserted


%-----------------------
% comment in text format (if you are not skilled in latex and don't want to be)
% using the sintax:

	%\begin{verbatim}
	% blablabla 
	%\end{verbatim}

% The verbatimg includes text as it is, as you could write in a normal text file 

% (BETTER) If uou want to write enhancing all the latex possibilities you 
% should add to you text a few commands in some particular cases. 
% In the following you have and example of a few chapters roughtly commented
% and written all in this file: remember that you can saparate
% each chapter in different files (this is always what a latex pro does) 
% and include them using the instruction: \input{./directoryxx/fileyy.tex}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Beginning of latex commands
% You can copy this in a new file (e.g. cap1/cap1.tex) and inlcude it here
% using the command : \input{./cap1/cap1.tex}


% chapter 1
\chapter{}


% include here only files for the first lesson and homeworks
% here the path to figures and VHDL should be ./cap1/

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% you can organize thje report usign section -> \section{Simulating an inverter}
% or subsection -> \subsection{simulating a particular type of inverter}

%%%%%%   First section
\section{Simulating an inverter}



The result of the simulation is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cap1:iv}.

% please note the use of the accent and the reference to the figure
% using the string in the label field below

	\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=3cm]{./logopoli}
	\caption{Caption for my first figure}
	\label{fig:cap1:iv}
	\end{figure}

As it can be observed the output ...

	\begin{verbatim}
	bla bla bla including comments between this ``verbatim'' commands
	you can ingore latex commands  	
	\end{verbatim}



%%%%%%   Second section
\section{Simulating a NAND gate}

% homework 1
\section{Simulating an OR gate}


%homework 2
\section{Simulating an EXOR gate}

% here the path to figures and VHDL should be ./cap2/

\section{Example for using some latex feature}

\subsection{Example of an itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item this is the first item
\item this is the second item...
\item if you want to change the point of the item do as in the following ite:
\item[-] whithin squared parentheses you can put a sign you like
\end{itemize} 


\subsection{Eample of an enumeration}

\begin{enumerate}
\item this is the first point
\item the second.....
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{example of a description}
\begin{description}
\item[latex] is a powerful editing and formatting language, whaich helps you
at writing reporte, books, letters, or whatever, just using the brain 
once at the beginning; it comes for free, and is completely portable
\item[word] is an awful terrible and nasty editing suite, it is proprietary,
not portable, it occupies a lot of space, you go mad with formatting,
and very often you loose you work all in a sudden. 
\end{description}


\subsection{Example of a table:}

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|ccc|}
pippo & pluto & indiana pipps & gilberto de pippis \\
topolino & minni & tip & tap \\
paperino & paperina & orazio & clarabella \\
qui & quo & qua & ottoperotto \\
zio paperone & gastone & paperoga & battista \\  
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{A caption for your table}
\label{A-lable-for-your-table}
\end{table}


Other features are available for table formatting: just refer to the manuals.
For what concerns equations: what do you think about the word equation editor?
Well, whatever you will try to do, you will loose your afternoom on it, and
still you are not sure it will have a decent aspect. The equation suite
in latex is extremely powerful, and her you anly a very small example:
refer to the manuals and to AMS-MATH suite for help.


\subsection{Example of a small equation:}

writing an equation on line is easy $a \cdot \int^{\infty}_0 i(t)
\frac{di}{dt}$
while if you want to better display it just include it in this way:
$$a \cdot \int^{\infty}_0 i(t) \frac{di}{dt}$$

and finally if you want to refer and number the equation as the
\ref{label-my-equation} then the syntax is:

\begin{equation}
a \cdot \int^{\infty}_0 i(t) \frac{di}{dt}
\label{label-my-equation}
\end{equation}
