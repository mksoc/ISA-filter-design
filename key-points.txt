Basic architecture:
- package to define constant, data types and functions
- parallelism due to addition overflow, but only +1 bit for our coefficients
- saturation of output result, which overflowed in some cases (modified C model)

Simulation:
- random pauses inside testbench

Synthesis:
- had to remove async resets from CU, connect rst_n directly to register and keep only IDLE state
- fmax = 357.14 MHz, area = 4742.51 -> set freq to 89.28 MHz

Look-ahead architecture:
- fixed internal parallelism with arbitrary big integer part, and fractional part equal to the one of new coefficients
- needed to shift left coefficients and input sample to align the fixed point
- results differed between VHDL and C because the feedback branch was subtracted in C, but added in VHDL and coefficients had opposite signs
