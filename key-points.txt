Basic architecture:
- package to define constant, data types and functions
- parallelism due to addition overflow, but only +1 bit for our coefficients
- saturation of output result, which overflowed in some cases (modified C model)

Simulation:
- random pauses inside testbench

Synthesis:
- had to remove async resets from CU, connect rst_n directly to register and keep only IDLE state
- fmax = 357.14 MHz, area = 4742.51 -> set freq to 89.28 MHz
